## Introduction

## Concept
Pokémon fangame inspired by classic titles like Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green. Redesigning locations, emulating new storylines, and other aspects of the classic games are all part of this varied approach.
## Experience Goals and Motivation

The player will also meet a variety of Pokémon from several different generations as they progress through the plot with updated features and enhanced updates to the classic titles.
## Background and History

The world of this game has Pokemon from generations 1-5. Battles between them are comparable to the straightforward hand game. rock-paper-scissors, with a exponential growth of difficulty as the player progresses through the story.
