#   Advanced Items Field Moves - Version 1.1.2
#===============================================================================

Hello - First of all thanks for downloading this
This is my first public codes that I have made

If you like this, leave a like and maybe a rating

If you have any idea for more stuff let me hear it

#===============================================================================
This plugin now requires the Hotfixes 1.0.3

This Pack contains a plug-and-play feature
with some exceptions

  1) You need to create the items inside the PBS folder, in the items.txt file
     you could copy and paste the items that are in the example items.txt

  2) This pack contains animations that need to be copied to show
     this need to go into the Data folder
     be sure before you copy it that animations are not conflicting with anything in your project
     This does not conflict with Follow Pokémon
     but you do need to add the animations file after you added Follow Pokémon if you would run that
     Or don't overwrite the file if you add Follow Pokémon later

  3) After you have copied the files if you run your game in debug mode and compile your Game
     If your game doesn't compiles by itself you can force it by holding down a key after you open the window
        SHIFT [Only Plugins]
        CTRL [Everything]

  4) Make a New Save File

  5) Everything is controlled in the Config file
